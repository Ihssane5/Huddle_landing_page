## My process
My process of building this challenge started with making the desktop version  looks close to the design model and then i tried to make it responsive in order to meet the challenge criterias.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

working on this challenge helped me deepen my knowledge using css properties mainly position property
I was proud of the html code i wrote since it's well organized and structured.
I'm proud of the  social media with the circles at the bottom of the page. I think it will be a better way to do it

```css
.footer div {
  height: 35px;
  width: 35px;
  border-radius: 50px;
  border: 2px solid white;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
### Continued development
I want to apply my html and css skills in other challenge and i want to make interactive web pages using javascript
